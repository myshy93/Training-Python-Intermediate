# Python Intermediate 1

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Python Intermediate course! This is the first part of the course as the it is split in two parts due to its complexity.

2. **[Functional programming](Lecture%202/Lecture%202.ipynb)** - Iterators, Generators, Namespaces
3. **[Logging and Time](Lecture%203/Lecture%203.ipynb)** - How to log for easier debug
4. **[Command line arguments](Lecture%204/Lecture%204.ipynb)** - Make your code more versatile
5. **[Unit testing](Lecture%205/Lecture%205.ipynb)** - Tests your code

### Project

During the course you will build a CLI tool, step by step with your new knowledge.

**Project name:** Build tracking tool.

**Description:** This tool will monitor a directory for content change. If a new build is placed inside,
the information about it will be exported in a html report file.

**CLI args:**
 - path to monitor
 - run mode: scan one or scheduled
 - output filename
 - help
 - version
 - verbosity
 - log path
